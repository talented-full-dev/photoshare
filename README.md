Photoshare is a learning app for Go and Angular.

The final aim:

- User can create posts with photos.
- User can make posts private/public.
- Other users can comment on posts.
- User can switch comments on/off.
- Simple search.
- Email user when someone comments on their posts.
- RSS feeds on all posts.
- Admins can edit/delete all posts and enable/disable user accounts.
- Users can sign up/in with at least one oauth client (Google, Facebook, Twitter)
- Runs on PostgreSQL backend.
- Twitter Boostrap-based design (yawn, but I'm not a designer...)
- Fully tested (or as much as possible) in front and backend.
- We can host the whole thing on Heroku/S3.

Of course not all of the above will happen at once, rather incremental steps.
